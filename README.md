## PHP Projects
This repository stores small projects using PHP and HTML with a Docker container. 

### Calculator
I built a calculator using PHP. The first number is input, an operator is selected from the dropdown, and a second number is input. Clicking `Calculate` produces the result of the calculation.

### Contact Form
I built a contact form with PHP based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q0gYjAVonI&t=14s) tutorial from Dani Krossing. This form allows a message to be emailed from a live webpage. 

### Searches with Regular Expressions
I used preg_match, preg_match_all, and preg_replace with Regex patterns including quantifiers and anchors to search strings. 

### User Profile Form
I tested form validation and data sanitizing with PHP through a user profile form that makes use of trim, htmlspecialchars, filter_var, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL, FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL, and in_array.


### PHP OOP 
I'm exploring object-oriented PHP following [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0eyrZgxdwhypQiZnYXM7z7-OTkcMgGPh) series from Dani Krossing.
