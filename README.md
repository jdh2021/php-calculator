## PHP Projects
This repository stores small projects I'm working on using PHP and HTML with a Docker container. 

### Calculator
I built a calculator using PHP. The first number is input, an operator is selected from the dropdown, and a second number is input. Clicking `Calculate` produces the result of the calculation.

### Contact Form
I built a contact form with PHP based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q0gYjAVonI&t=14s) tutorial from Dani Krossing. This form allows a message to be emailed from a live webpage. 

### Setup

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) 
- Run `docker-compose build` then `docker-compose up` in terminal. 
- Access in the browser at http://localhost:8000/
