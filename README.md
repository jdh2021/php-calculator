## PHP Projects
This repository stores small projects using PHP and HTML with a Docker container. 

### Calculator
I built a calculator using PHP. The first number is input, an operator is selected from the dropdown, and a second number is input. Clicking `Calculate` produces the result of the calculation.

### Contact Form
I built a contact form with PHP based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q0gYjAVonI&t=14s) tutorial from Dani Krossing. This form allows a message to be emailed from a live webpage.
